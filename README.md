Data Analysis on Airbnb Data

Hello,
For this Project, I am using 2016 Airbnb data for Seattle. The name of the data is as follows:
1.) listings: This data file contains details of all the listings on Airbnb in Seattle for the year 2016. 
2.) calendar: This data file contains the availability of the listings for the whole year of 2016 and Jan of 2017 on daily level.

The libraries used in this project are: Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib

Motivation: As Airbnb has such extensive amount of data, it would be interesting to see some specifics that might help consumers make informed decisions. 

Results: In the year 2016, the average price of a property for one night was around $120. The average here is the median value instead of the mean, as few of the values were very high. Most of the properties are either apartments or homes and had good ratings. The availability was between 50-70% throughout the year, with the year end being the best time to visit Seattle. 

I would love to Thank Airbnb for providing me with their data. 


The CRISP-DM Process:
Understanding the Business: Airbnb is an online service which provides a platform for posting your rental property and helps connect the renters to the customers. It is important that the customer as well as the renters are well informed so that the service profits with it's quality service. The scope of this project involves answering the following Questions:
Q1 - On average, how much does it cost to stay in Seattle for one night?
Q2 - What is the average cost of stay based on the property type?
Q3 - What are the average ratings for each of the property type?
Q4 - How does the property distribution look like?
Q5 - What is the best month to visit Seattle based on the pricing and availibilty?

Data Understanding: By observing the data, I found that answering questions mentioned above doesn't specifically require machine learning algorithms. While machine learning provides us with powerful predictive techniques, descriptive analytics is sufficient to serve the purpose. Please refer the jupyter notebook for the analysis. 
The missing values were filled using the mean for the ratings. Using the mean made more sense as the range of the ratings was very less and so mean would have given a satisfactory result.
